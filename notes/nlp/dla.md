- is the process of identifying and categorizing the regions of interest in the scanned image of a text document

- the detection / labeling of the different sections as text body, illustrations, math symbols, and tables embedded in a document is called <b>geometric layout analysis</b>.
- the text zones play different logical roles inside the document (titles, captions, footnotes, etc.) and this kind of semantic labeling is the scope of the <b>logical layout analysis</b>.

- Document layout analysis is the union of geometric and logical labeling
